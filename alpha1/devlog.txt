Got the arduino tentacle sheild to start spitting out values over I2C.
Compiled the first alpha assembly of the doser project.
Began integrating the SerialUSB library with the tentacle async readings example from the Atlas code library.
Goal for next round is to get the sensor data to pass from void(loop) into the SerialUSB class as a byte stream so
it can be sent from the arduino to the RPi over USB. Finish implementing SerialUSB::sendSerialData() function

-Migrated over to custom Eclipse build for programming due to frustrations with both Arduino IDE and Notepad++
-Traced through getSerialData function to better understand its use
-Began writing sendSerialData function, found that the String class in Arduino is very frustrating to use. Attempted 
to convert Strings to jagged character array. So far unsuccessful. 
-Task for next time: modify original Whitebox code to allow for jagged char array when writing sensor data.

-Mostly completed sendSerialData function
-unable to upload from Eclipse to Arduino directly, some kind of bootloader error that I can't work around. Have been 
transfering code to RPi and building/uploading using ino.
-Tested some of the code functionality using ino serial through SSH, the serial function will not print out the 
transmitted data correctly so I have had to gibble it.
-Goal for next time is to reconstruct the python end of the serial example I have been modifying to prove that the RPi 
can spit out the values the Arduino is sending it, further proving that the one direction of communication functions.
