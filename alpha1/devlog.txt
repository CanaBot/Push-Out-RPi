Got the arduino tentacle sheild to start spitting out values over I2C.
Compiled the first alpha assembly of the doser project.
Began integrating the SerialUSB library with the tentacle async readings example from the Atlas code library.
Goal for next round is to get the sensor data to pass from void(loop) into the SerialUSB class as a byte stream so
it can be sent from the arduino to the RPi over USB. Finish implementing SerialUSB::sendSerialData() function
